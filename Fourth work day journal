Fourth entry (13/1/2021 8:20pm – 9:30pm (75 minutes))
Today I finished problem 5 and started solving problem 6. Last time I tried to use math.inf to represent infinity as I did not know which number is the smallest that also fit in the description. Today I realized that I was thinking about this all wrong and I took a different approach. The most important thing is to not miss a number, so why not start from 1 and add 1 every time the number does not fit in the description? That is exactly what today’s approach was. I created a variable i that had the value 1, and then I used an if statement which included the required criteria. If the if statement returns True, then the program stops. If the if statement returns False, then i will plus one. I wanted to stop the program after the True is returned, so I put in the line “break”. I forgot that break would only work in a loop, so I just created a while loop: while True. I specifically chose 0 because I know that the problem asks for positive numbers. This program runs fine, but it takes too long to run the program. I waited for 45 seconds before I got the results. 

Then I started on the sixth problem. This question is simple to understand and I quickly drew a diagram to outline my code. I only had time to draw the diagram but what I am thinking is to take the numbers and write two lines of code that will calculate what the problem wants. Then another which calculates the result. 

I think today’s questions are easy because they do not require complicated programs to solve. It is nice to practice more fundamental stuff like the if statement in problem 5.
